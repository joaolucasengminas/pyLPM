pyLPM is a free and open source python geostatistical library intended to be used in a jupyter notebook.

The software is composed by five modules:

* **GSLib** module is a wrapper on top of GSLib algorithms to permit a seamless integration with pyLPM.
* **Geostat algorithms** houses geostatistical algorithms developed by LPM or that are not available in the GSLib open source version.
* **Variography** module is packed with a full toolkit for spatial continuity analysis and interactive variogram modeling.
* **Utilities** is where the user will find functions to make the workflow easy and fast.
* **Plots** is a rich plotting functions library, based on plotly. All the plots are interactive.
